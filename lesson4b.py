# Loops -> Sometimes we may need to do a piece of work a number of repeated times, in such cases, we may use loops. 
#  A loop is a control structure that allows us to execute a block of code reapetedly until a certain condition is met
# There are two types of loops in python i.e The for loop and the while loop. 
# Below is the syntax for a loop in pythonn :
"""
for variable in range (n)
     #a block of code to be executed
