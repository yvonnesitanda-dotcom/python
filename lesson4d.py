#Python while loop
# While loop executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true. The syntax of a whie loop is as follows :
"""

while keyword ,
followed by the condition / statement to be evaluated,
followed by a full colon (:),
code to be printed out ,
increement/ decreement
"""

number = 0
while number < 5:
    print("Hello Moses" , number)
    number = number + 1

print("===============")
# Create a python program that prints the even numbers from 50 to 70 using while loop

number = 50
while  number < 71:
    print(number)
    number += 2

# below is a decreament example that prints the multiples of 3 from 201 to 150

print('===============================')
number = 201
while number >= 150:
    print(number)
    number = number -3
