# Python lists
# A list in python is a group of item arranged in an ordered way.
# A list is introduced by the use of the square brackets {}. 
# The items of a list are stored inside of indexes . Note : in programming , we start counting from index zero (0) . 
# A list is mutable i.e the content of a list can be changed.

cars = ["BMW" , "Benz" , "Hiance" , "Prado" , "Probox" , "Mclarel" ,"Range"]

print(cars)
print(type(cars))

# Accessing items of a list
print(cars[2])
print("The car on index four is:",cars[4])


#List slicing - This is creating a list from a given bigger list
print(cars[4:])


#printing from index zero to three
print(cars[0:4])

# printing from hiance to probox
print(cars[2:5])

# List Mutability
# We use the function append to add an item at the end of a list.
cars.append("Mercedes")
print(cars)

cars.append("Subaru")
print(cars)

# We use the pop function to remove an item at the end of the list
cars.pop()
print(cars)

# We use an index to add itemss to a list
cars[5]= "Pajero"
print(cars)

# We can use the sort function to sort out items in alphabetical order
cars.sort(reverse= True)
print(cars)

del cars [4]
print(cars)

cars.pop(4)
print(cars)
